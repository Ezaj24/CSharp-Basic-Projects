# C# Basic Projects – Console Apps

This repository contains a collection of beginner-level C# console applications I created while learning programming fundamentals and building my logic step-by-step.

Each project focuses on a specific real-world use case using core C# concepts like classes, loops, arrays, functions, lists, and conditionals.
